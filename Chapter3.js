"use strict"
/*
The "use strict" directive switches the engine to the “modern” mode, changing the behavior of some built-in features. We’ll see the details as we study.
The strict mode is enabled by "use strict" at the top. Also there are several language features like “classes” and “modules” that enable strict mode automatically.
The strict mode is supported by all modern browsers.
It’s always recommended to start scripts with "use strict". All examples in this tutorial assume so, unless (very rarely) specified otherwise.
